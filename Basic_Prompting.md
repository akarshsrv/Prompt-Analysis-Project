## Basic Prompting
Basic Prompting is a crucial component of AI Prompt Engineering, which involves designing prompts for AI models to generate natural language text. 
It's essential to understand the different ways in which prompt engineering can be used. Instruction Prompts provide models with clear instructions 
about what text to generate, Coding Prompts use specific code instructions to guide text generation, and Role Play Prompts prompt models to take on 
a specific role and generate text accordingly. Developers can use these different prompts to create models that generate natural language text tailored 
to specific use cases and scenarios. The Basic Prompting concept is just the beginning of AI Prompt Engineering. We're excited to provide resources for 
developers and researchers to learn more and contribute to this exciting field.
